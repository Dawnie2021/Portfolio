            <p>My name is Dawn and I am excited to introduce myself to you. I am a 35-year-old coding enthusiast who is
                currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp with the goal of becoming a software developer. With a strong
                determination and a passion for solving complex problems, I have always been interested in programming
                and coding languages. I am confident that my current skill set, coupled with my dedication to learning,
                makes me a strong candidate for a software developer position. Throughout the bootcamp, I have gained
                hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML/CSS, and JavaScript

                <!-- added 3 img inside of a div folder for my work -->
                <!-- added a paragraph about my first challenge -->
                <p> The first challenge in my coding bootcamp was focused on semantic code refactoring. The challenge
                    involved taking poorly written, non-semantic HTML code and refactoring it to make it more
                    structured,
                    accessible, and easier to maintain.
                    I quickly realized that the key to semantic code is clear and concise HTML tags for different types
                    of
                    content. I began by analyzing each section of the HTML snippet and adding proper semantic tags to
                    accurately describe its content.
                    To improve accessibility, I added alt attributes to all images and included a descriptive title
                    element
                    in the head of the document. I also ensured that all links had descriptive anchor text that
                    explained
                    their purpose and destination.
                    Throughout the challenge, I remained mindful of the importance of clean and readable code. By the
                    end of
                    the challenge, I had transformed a jumbled, poorly written HTML page into a well-structured and
                    readable
                    document. Overall, the experience helped me to understand the importance of clear, semantic, and
                    accessible code when developing web applications.
