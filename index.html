    <p>My name is Dawn and I am excited to introduce myself to you. I am a 35-year-old coding enthusiast who is currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp with the goal of becoming a software developer. With a strong determination and a passion for solving complex problems, I have always been interested in programming and coding languages. I am confident that my current skill set, coupled with my dedication to learning, makes me a strong candidate for a software developer position. Throughout the bootcamp, I have gained hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML/CSS, and JavaScript</p>
