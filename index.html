                <p>My name is Dawn Nguyen and I am excited to introduce myself to you. I am a 35-year-old coding
                    enthusiast who
                    is currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp with the goal of becoming a software developer. I am
                    confident that my current skill set, coupled with my
                    dedication to
                    learning, makes me a strong candidate for a software developer position. Throughout the bootcamp, I
                    have
                    gained hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML/CSS, and
                    JavaScript.
