                <p>My name is Dawn and I am excited to introduce myself to you. I am a 35-year-old coding enthusiast who
                    is
                    currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp with the goal of becoming a software developer. With a
                    strong
                    determination and a passion for solving complex problems, I have always been interested in
                    programming
                    and coding languages. I am confident that my current skill set, coupled with my dedication to
                    learning,
                    makes me a strong candidate for a software developer position. Throughout the bootcamp, I have
                    gained
                    hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML/CSS, and
                    JavaScript
